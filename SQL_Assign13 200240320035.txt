==========================================================
1) Create a union of two queries that shows
 the names, cities, and ratings of all customers. 
Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have 
the words “High Rating”, 
while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.

=>>
select cname,city,'High Rating' rating from CUSTOMERS
 where rating >=200
 union
 select cname,city,'Low Rating' rating from CUSTOMERS
 where rating<200;
==========================================================
2) Write a command that produces the name and number of
 each salesperson and each customer with more than one current order. 
 Put the results in alphabetical order.
=>>
select snum, sname from salespeople a
 where 2<= (select count(snum) from orders b where a.snum = b.snum )
union
select cnum, cname from customers a
  where 2<= (select count(cnum) from orders b where a.cnum = b.cnum )
  order by sname;

==========================================================
3) Form a union of three queries.
 Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San Jose; 
 the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose;
 and the third the onums of all orders on October 3.
 Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate
 any redundancies between either of them and the first.
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy.
 This is besides the point.)
 =>>
  select snum from salespeople where city = 'san jose'
     union
  select cnum from customers where city = 'san jose'
     union all
  select onum from orders where odate = '1990-11-03';
