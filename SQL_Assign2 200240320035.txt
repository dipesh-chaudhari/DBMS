4) Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
=>>#In RDBMS, table is not a file every row is a file.
	#Rows of table are not stored sequntially.
	#ROws of a table are scattered.
	#When you insert into a table, wherever the system find the free space in DB sever HD, it will store the row there.
	#when you update a row, if the row length is increasing , then the entire row may be moved to some other address.
	#Later when you select from the table, you will find the row at some other position in the output.
	#Hence it is not possible to view the first or last 'N' rows of a table.
